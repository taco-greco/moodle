To connect to Open Badge Factory, the plugin needs an API key.

OAuth2 key:

Pro level clients can also connect with OAuth2. This supports multiple clients on one Moodle installation.

On the API key page click on `Generate new client secret` for OAuth2 Client Credentials. Give a description for the key and copy the client id and secret values into OBF Moodle plugin settings, in `Site administration > Open Badges > Settings`.
